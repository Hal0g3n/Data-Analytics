    "Recently on the news, I saw a lot more articles related to natural disasters and climate change movements. For this sudden spike in natural disasters to happen admist the COVID-19 pandemic, I found it too coincidental. Not only that, there are many new weather records set in this COVID-19 period. July 2021 breaking the record of hottest recorded month is one such example.\n",
    "Therefore, I decided to take matters into my own hands and confirm if the pandemic is related to this strange spikes."

    "   - Most countries analysed showed a significant decrease during the initial lockdown period (Jan 2021 - April 2021)\n",
    "   - After that initial drop, some countries showed moderate negative correlation between lockdown severity and carbon emissions\n",
    "   - This means that lockdowns are reducing carbon emissions, for some countries.\n",
    "2. Are lockdowns increasing deforestation?\n",
    "   - No, lockdowns and deforestation are completely unrelated at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size = 3><u>*Looking at the world as a whole,*</u></font>\n",
    "1. Does lockdowns increase global temperatures?\n",
    "   - No, global temperature is not even correlated with the severity of lockdowns at all.\n",
    "   - They are independent of each other even on a country wide scale\n",
    "2. Are lockdowns causing more air pollution?\n",

    "This is due to the fact that the variables measured are not just affected by their own country but by others too.<br>\n",
    "For example, air pollution in Singapore could be due to Indonesia's slash-and-burn practices and the smoke got blown by the wind into Singapore.\n",
    "However, variables like carbon emissions depend solely on the country's handling of the situation, and can thus be analysed independently.\n",
